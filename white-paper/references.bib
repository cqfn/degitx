  abstract = {
    The distributed transaction commit problem requires reaching agreement
    on whether a transaction is committed or aborted. The classic Two-Phase Commit protocol
    blocks if the coordinator fails. Fault-tolerant consensus algorithms also reach agreement
    but do not block whenever any majority of the processes are working. The Paxos Commit algorithm
    runs a Paxos consensus algorithm on the commit/abort decision of each participant to obtain
    a transaction commit protocol that uses 2F + 1 coordinators and makes progress if at least F + 1
    of them are working properly. Paxos Commit has the same stable-storage write delay and can be
    implemented to have the same message delay in the fault-free case as Two-Phase Commit,
    but it uses more messages. The classic Two-Phase Commit algorithm is obtained as the special F = 0
    case of the Paxos Commit algorithm.

abstract = {In a July 2000 conference keynote, Eric Brewer, now VP of engineering at Google and a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, publicly postulated the CAP (consistency, availability, and partition tolerance) theorem, which would change the landscape of how distributed storage systems were architected. Brewer’s conjecture--based on his experiences building infrastructure for some of the first Internet search engines at Inktomi--states that distributed systems requiring always-on, highly available operation cannot guarantee the illusion of coherent, consistent single-system operation in the presence of network partitions, which cut communication between active servers. Brewer’s conjecture proved prescient: in the following decade, with the continued rise of large-scale Internet services, distributed-system architects frequently dropped "strong" guarantees in favor of weaker models--the most notable being eventual consistency.},
